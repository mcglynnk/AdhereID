    "The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning model to predict medication adherence.  Medication non-adherence is a widespread problem in the healthcare industry. About 131 million Americans (half the population!) take at least one prescription medication, and 10~25% of these people don't take their prescription as prescribed.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "A tool to predict medication adherence could be used in the doctor's office or pharmacy to determine which patients are at risk for non-adherence; based on this prediction, the healthcare provider could take action to help the patient comply such as providing information on managing side effects, suggesting a pill reminder app, or prescribing a lower-cost or shorter-term treatment.\n",
    "    \n",
    "While adherence prediction has been tackled by academia and large healthcare companies alike, typically adherence has been inferred from a combination of electronic health record data and insurance claims data.  In this project, I decided to test whether publicly available demographic and patient-reported medical literacy data could be used in a similar way.\n",
